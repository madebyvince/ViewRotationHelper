## Features

- **Quick Orthogonal Views**: Six buttons for instant access to Top, Bottom, Front, Back, Left, and Right views
- **View Rotation**: Rotate any orthogonal view by ±90° increments
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean panel in the 3D View sidebar with clear icons
- **Efficient Workflow**: No need to use the numpad or manually rotate locked orthogonal views

## Why This Add-on?

Blender's default orthogonal views (accessible via numpad 1, 3, 7, etc.) are locked and cannot be rotated. This add-on fills that gap by allowing you to:
- Set any orthogonal view with a single click
- Rotate these views in 90° increments
- Combine views and rotations for precise angles (e.g., Top view rotated 90°)

## Installation

1. Download the `view_rotation_helper.py` file
2. Open Blender and go to `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Add-ons`
3. Click `Install...` at the top
4. Select the downloaded `view_rotation_helper.py` file
5. Enable the add-on by checking the checkbox next to "3D View: View Rotation Helper"

## Usage

1. In the 3D Viewport, press `N` to open the sidebar
2. Navigate to the `View` tab
3. You'll see the "View Rotation Helper" panel with:
   - **Orthogonal Views section**: 6 buttons arranged in pairs (Top/Bottom, Front/Back, Left/Right)
   - **Rotate Current View section**: Two buttons for -90° and +90° rotation

### Example Workflow

- Click `Top` to set the top view
- Click `+90°` to rotate the view 90 degrees clockwise
- Click `-90°` to rotate back or continue rotating

## Compatibility

- **Blender Version**: 3.0 and above
